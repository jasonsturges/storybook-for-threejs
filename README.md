## Background

Often conventions involve developing components in isolation and leveraging GUI frameworks such as [dat.GUI](https://github.com/dataarts/dat.gui) for controls.

For projects of greater complexity there may be a need to classify numerous scenarios, which is the catalyst for this project.

This is a work-in-progress, currently alpha at best.
